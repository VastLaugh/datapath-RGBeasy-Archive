Archive is from 11/13/2020 and is the source of build 1 (0.0.1).

I have included both Build 1 and Build 2 binaries in the bin folder.

Do note, I did not acquire these by compiling this source code.

Build 1 was available on <a href="http://r3.fyi/">R³. RGB Retro Resource</a> and their discord server, which is also where these source files were found.

Build 2 i had a personal backup of.
