I am not sure what LICENSE beeanyew had on this so... there isn't one.

Archive is from 11/13/2020 and is the source of build 1 (0.0.1).

I have included both Build 1 and Build 2 binaries in the bin folder. Note that these are not compiled from the source code in this archive.

Build 1 was available on r3.fyi and their discord server.

Build 2 i had a personal backup of.
